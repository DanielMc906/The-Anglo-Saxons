<h3>Report on the Anglo-Saxons</h3>	
<h4>Introduction</h4></u>

<p>
When the Roman rule in Britain ended in 410 AD, 49 years later in 459 AD the Angles and the Saxons began to invade Britain. Unlike the Romans who like to live in big towns, the Anglo-Saxons prefer to live in small villages. Have you ever thought about what food they ate, and what type of jobs they did?

 Anglo-Saxons had</h4></u> <img src="the_anglo_saxons_picture_1" width="200" height="200" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;"  ><img src="the_anglo_saxons_picture_1" width="200" height="200" align="right" ><br><br>
<p>Are you aware that the Anglo-Saxons were mostly vegetarian. Vegetables <br>they ate included onions, garlic, cabbage, turnips,<br> beetroot, parsnips, carrots (Which back then wear white) beans and peas. In addition, they  
ateavailable fruits, cherries, berries, apples and plums. They also turned fruit into alcohol, which they <br>had to drink because the water was often polluted. Their favourite meets were deer and wild boar, and the food was cooked over the fire in the middle of the house. Sometimes the best cuts of meat would go to the Lord (the chief of the village) and the wealthier<br> families.The fire in the house/hall could also cook stews in a large cauldron, smoke would rise up and preserve the fish and meat. In addition, they used salt mined in Worcestershire for preserving food. </p><h4>What jobs did the Anglo-Saxons do</h4>
